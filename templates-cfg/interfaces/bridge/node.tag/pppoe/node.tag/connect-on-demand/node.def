# Configuration template for the .../pppoe/node.tag/connect-on-demand parameter
# 
# 
# This parameter has no "value" associated with it. If the parameter
# exists, then "connect on demand" mode is enabled.  The link will not
# be brought up automatically at boot time, but but will be brought up
# when IP traffic needs to be sent on the link.  If the link goes down
# for any reason, it will be brought back up when traffic needs to be
# sent.
# 
# If the parameter does not exist, then "connect on demand" mode will
# be disabled.  In this mode, the link will be brought up
# automatically at boot time.  If it goes down for any reason, the
# system will attempt to bring it back up immediately.
# 
# This parameter is usually used in conjunction with the idle-timeout
# parameter, which disconnects the link after some period of time
# without traffic.  Can only be used if remote-address is also set.
